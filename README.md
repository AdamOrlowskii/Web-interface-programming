# Web interface programming - Programowanie interfejs√≥w webowych

lab3 and lab3+1 are in different branches.

lab3+1 domain address: https://bookshop-88d5d.web.app/

Running locally lab3+1 via "npm run dev" might not work, but using "npm start" works.

In lab3+1 the only thing that works is google logging, I couldn't fix the problem with not showing the other page, in which I had the possibility of adding the new books to the database, so the database exists, but that would be all.
